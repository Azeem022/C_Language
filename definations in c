#What is Array in C?
An Array is a group of similar types of elements. It has a contiguous memory location. It makes the code optimized, easy to traverse and easy to sort. The size and type of arrays cannot be changed after its declaration.
# What is C language?
C is a mid-level and procedural programming language. The Procedural programming language is also known as the structured programming language is a technique in which large programs are broken down into smaller modules, and each module uses structured code
#When was C language developed?
C language was developed in 1972 at bell laboratories of AT&T by Danish Ritche.
#WHAT IS STATIC VARIABLE ?
A variable which is declared as static is known as a static variable. The static variable retains its value between multiple function calls.
EXAMPLE:    #include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	func();
	func();
	return 0;
}
void func()
{
	int a=10;
	static b=20;
	a++;
	b++;
	printf("%d\n",a);
	printf("%d\n",b);
}
#What is the use of the function in C?
C functions are used to avoid the rewriting the same code again and again in our program.
C functions can be called any number of times from any place of our program.
C functions provide the reusability concept, i.e., it breaks the big task into smaller tasks so that it makes the C program more understandable.
#WHAT IS CALL BY VALUE ?
When a copy of the value is passed to the function, then the original value is not modified.
EXAMPLE:
#include<stdio.h>
void swap (int a, int b);
int main()
{
	int a,b;
	printf("entre two number a & b :");
	scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);
	swap(a,b);
	printf("main function a=%d b=%d",a,b);
	return 0;
}                                                                                  AFTER SWAPPING
void swap (int a, int b)                          OUTPUT IS :SUPPOSE WE GIVE INPUT A=12, & B=21  MAIN VALUE 
{                                                                                  A=21, & B=12   CALLING VALUE
	int temp;
	temp=a;
	a=b;
	b=temp;
	printf("calling function a=%d b=%d",a,b);
	
}  
# CALL BY REFERENCE:
When a copy of the value is passed to the function, then the original value is modified.
EXAMPLE:
#include<stdio.h>
void swap (int *p, int *q);
int main()
{
	int a=100,b=200;
	swap(&a,&b);
	printf("a=%d b=%d",a,b);
	return 0;
}
void swap (int *p, int *q)
{
	int temp;
	temp=*p;                                        OUTPUT IS :      P=200, & Q=100
	*p=*q;                                                           A=200, & B=100
	*q=temp;
	printf("calling function p=%d q=%d",*p,*q);
	
}
#WHAT IS POINTER IN C?
 variables that hold the address of another variable this is called pointer variable.
